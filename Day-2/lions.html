<h1>The Lions</h1>

<p>in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, but is absent in dense forests. <br>
It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night and at twilight. <br>
A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. <br>
Prides vary in size and composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. <br> 
Females cooperate when hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe </p>
